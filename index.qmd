**1. Positioning data**

This is what **Geodesy** does. Focus is on *mathematical foundation* (coordinates, Earth’s shape).

Keywords: precision, geolocation, GPS, LIDAR, coordinates system...

This is what **Cartography** does. Focus is on *data visualisation*.

Keywords: projections, shapes, size, colour...

For the sake of simplicity, we are going to summarise the process of making maps into two processes: 1. Positioning data 2. Displaying data

## Are maps objective?

Each map involves a series of decisions that are anything but objective:

Each map involves a series of decisions that are anything but objective:

## What is included (and what is not!)

If we were to add everything in a map, it would be as complex as the Earth, and therefore not useful. -> Thematic maps

Some maps from the same region, i.e. from Google, OSM, Apple, Ordnance Survey...?

## Projections

## Orientation {background-image="img/north_down.jpg" background-size="contain" }


## Centre {background-image="img/street-fighter-ii-character-select-screen.jpg" background-size="contain"}


# Maps and Power {background-color="#3C1053"}

These decisions have implications:

-   used to exert power

-   to exclude / include

# Our research {background-color="#BBDF46"} 

Can Digital Goods Be Neutral? Evaluating OpenStreetMap’s equity through participatory data visualisation

## Motivation

Use data visualisations to understand whether these decisions had a positive or negative impact in under-represented communities.

## OSM

We've mentioned already OSM. OSM is great.

## What?

- Is OSM as neutral as it claims to be? 
- How is the notion of neutrality being implemented? How is it affecting other, underrepresented demographics?
- Are there


## How?

Participatory research: teaming with geochicas and workshops

## Co-design visualisation

Image of the dashboard


## Workshop on alternative cartography

You are invited!
