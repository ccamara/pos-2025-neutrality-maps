## How are maps made? {.smaller}

:::::: columns
::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}
**1. Geodesy**

Is what figuring out where things are and how to record them. Focus is on *mathematical foundations* (coordinates, Earth’s shape).

![](https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.aar6218/abs/google%20car_16x9.jpg)

This was once a huge scientific enterprise, today this is done by satellite and most of us, even very specialist geographers don't have to think about it very much.

Keywords: precision, geolocation, GPS, LIDAR, coordinates system...
:::

:::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}
::: large
**2. Cartogrpahy**

Is how we *visualize* information about *things* in the world on maps .

![](img/960px-Nova_totius_Terrarum_Orbis_geographica_ac_hydrographica_tabula_(Hendrik_Hondius)_balanced.jpg)

The history of cartography is long and detailed, and the question of what was mapped by whom has dramatically shaped the modern world.

Keywords: projections, shapes, size, colour...

::: notes
For the sake of simplicity, we are going to summarise the process of making maps into two processes: 1. Positioning data 2. Displaying data

**Governments**

Motivation: public service

*Official maps*

**Companies**

![](img/cov_google_map.png) Motivation: Business model.

-   Google, Microsoft, Apple...
-   ESRI, Carto

Specific, detailed maps, related to their business model.

## Are maps objective?

![](img/Well-Yes-But-Actually-No.gif)

:::: r-fit-text

Each map involves a series of decisions that are anything but objective
:::
::::


## Projections

![](https://www.joaoleitao.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Several-projections-of-a-world-map.jpg)

::: fragment
No projection is perfect! Projection is an 'unsolvable problem' in that however we do it we are going to end up with some distortion somewhere on our map.
:::

::: notes
The first decision we must make before we can even map anything is what projection we are going to use.

A projection, is how we turn the the 3D globe of the earth into the 2D plane of map we see on a peice of paper or a a screen.

No projection is perfect! Projection is an 'unsolvable problem' in that however we do it we are going to end up with some distortion somewhere on our map.

::: notes
All maps must make decisions about what is included and what is not.

After all, If we were to add everything in a map, it would be as complex as the Earth, and therefore not useful.

# So what? {background-color="#3C1053"}

All maps are political and anything but neutral:

- They follow a political agenda
- Unconcious bias

Either way, they influence/impact other people's lifes, especially in less privileged/underrepresented population:

- Origin/Location
- Gender
- Sexual orientation...

There's a long history of maps and power ILLUSTRATIVE MAP HERE?

# Our research {background-color="#BBDF46"}

Can Digital Goods Be Neutral? Evaluating OpenStreetMap’s equity through participatory data visualisation

## Motivation

Use data visualisations to understand whether these decisions had a positive or negative impact in under-represented communities.

## OpenStreetMap (OSM)

![](img/osm_coventry.png){fig-alt="An OpenStreetMap map of Coventry"}

### OSM is huge!

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](img/graph3.png){fig-alt="A graph of OpenStreetMap features"}
:::
:::::

## OSM is everywhere!

*Major Sites*: Amazon, Apple, Baidu Maps, Facebook, Microsoft, Wikipedia and Wikimedia

*Transport*: Air France, Alaska Airlines, Deutsche Bahn, Grab, SNCF (French rail agency), Uber Geodata Software and Services: CARTO, Digital Globe, ESRI, Garmin, Mapbox, Telenav

*Government*: Agence Française de Développement , Government of Brazil, Government of Italy: President’s Office, Police Scotland, US National Park Service, US State Department, USAID, Peace Corps….

## What?

-   Is OSM as neutral as it claims to be?
-   How is the notion of neutrality being implemented?
-   How is 'neutrality' affecting other, underrepresented demographics?

## How?

Participatory research: teaming with *GeoChicas* and workshops

GeoChicas is a collective of feminist women linked to OpenStreetMap, originally Spanish-speaking, who work for women's empowerment and the reduction of the gender gap in OpenStreetMap communities and in communities associated with the world of free software and open data.
