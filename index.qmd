## How are maps made? {.smaller}

:::::: columns
::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}
**1. Geodesy**

Is what figuring out where things are and how to record them. Focus is on *mathematical foundations* (coordinates, Earth’s shape).

![](https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.aar6218/abs/google%20car_16x9.jpg)

This was once a huge scientific enterprise, today this is done by satellite and most of us, even very specialist geographers don't have to think about it very much.

Keywords: precision, geolocation, GPS, LIDAR, coordinates system...
:::

:::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}
::: large
**2. Cartogrpahy**

Is how we *visualize* information about *things* in the world on maps .

![](img/960px-Nova_totius_Terrarum_Orbis_geographica_ac_hydrographica_tabula_(Hendrik_Hondius)_balanced.jpg)

The history of cartography is long and detailed, and the question of what was mapped by whom has dramatically shaped the modern world.

Keywords: projections, shapes, size, colour...

::: notes
For the sake of simplicity, we are going to summarise the process of making maps into two processes: 1. Positioning data 2. Displaying data

Each map involves a series of decisions that are anything but objective

## Projections

![](https://www.joaoleitao.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Several-projections-of-a-world-map.jpg)

::: fragment
No projection is perfect! Projection is an 'unsolvable problem' in that however we do it we are going to end up with some distortion somewhere on our map.
:::

::: notes
The first decision we must make before we can even map anything is what projection we are going to use.

A projection, is how we turn the the 3D globe of the earth into the 2D plane of map we see on a peice of paper or a a screen.

No projection is perfect! Projection is an 'unsolvable problem' in that however we do it we are going to end up with some distortion somewhere on our map.

Or take the example of a crime map. Usually expressed in maps like this. Without any context, as it crime simply happens in some places. How would the story change if displayed public investment, too ...or worse, ethnicity?

## Maps and power {.smaller .center background-color="#393A3B"}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
All maps are political and anything but neutral:

-   They follow a political agenda
-   Prone to (unconcious) bias

Either way, they influence/impact other people's lifes, especially in less privileged/underrepresented population:

-   Origin/Geography
-   Gender
-   Sexual orientation...

There's a long history of maps and power

Can Digital Goods Be Neutral?
:::

Evaluating OpenStreetMap’s equity through participatory data visualisation

## Motivation

We wanted to understand how these decisions around mapping were impacting under-represented communities.

We wanted to study a particular type of digital good: OpenStreetMap, to understand how neutrality is used to favour or hamper equity.

::: notes
Kowing about all of this, and inspired by the work of feminist geographers and d'Ignazio and Lauren data feminism principles, we wanted to understand whether these decisions decisions had a positive or negative impact in under-represented communities.

## OpenStreetMap (OSM)

OSM is the largest and most exhaustive collaborative map of the world.

:::::

::: notes
We have already mentioned OSM as the wikipedia of the maps

We know already that OSM is a collaborative map, but it is also a database, and because all their items are geo-located, we call it a "geospatial" database.
:::

##  {.center .smaller}

::: r-fit-text
OSM's data, **contributed by 10,000,000 volunteers**,

complements **official data sources**, and

populates thousands of **tools and services**.
:::

**Major Sites**: [Amazon]{.highlight-text}, [Apple]{.highlight-text}, Baidu Maps, Facebook, [Microsoft]{.highlight-text}, Wikipedia and Wikimedia

**Transport**: [Air France]{.highlight-text}, Alaska Airlines, Deutsche Bahn, Grab, SNCF (French rail agency), [Uber]{.highlight-text}, Geodata Software and Services: CARTO, Digital Globe, ESRI, [Garmin]{.highlight-text}, Mapbox, Telenav

**Government**: Agence Française de Développement, Government of Brazil, Government of Italy: President’s Office, [Police Scotland]{.highlight-text}, US National Park Service, US State Department, USAID, Peace Corps….

::: notes
OSM is huge and is everywhere!
:::

##  {.center}

::: r-fit-text
Like Wikipedia, **OSM is based**

on principles of **openness** and **neutrality**
:::

“[OpenStreetMap maps world as it exists]{.highlight-text}, and includes mapping borders and countries according to actual current situation and [not a preferred or ideal situation]{.highlight-text}” ([OSM Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Disputed_territories))

## What? {.center}

::: r-fit-text
-   Is OSM as neutral as it claims to be?
-   How is the notion of neutrality being implemented?
-   How is 'neutrality' affecting other, underrepresented demographics?
:::

## How? {.smaller}

Results are not representative, but significative: show a clear over-representation of certain demographics.

We've created visualisations like this to understand how heterogeneous is or is not

## How do users contribute to OSM? {.smaller}

![A dashboard showing how groups contribute to OSM](img/osm_dashboard_1.png)

Initial findings show differences in how women contribute to OSM.

::: notes
We've created a dashboard showing how a group of users contribute to OSM so we can compare how similar or different are the contributions patterns of certain users.

## Inclusive cartographies {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
Planning a series of workhops aimed at **creating maps that address particular needs of underrepresented minorities using data that is available in OpenStreetMap**

Prompts:

-   Aim: what would you want the map to help you with?

-   Iconography: how are the icons being used?

-   Information being displayed or not: what do you want to be seen? How would you like it to be represented?

Audience:

-   **People from non-hegemonic demographics** (women, racialized, LGTBQ+) who feel that current maps do not sufficiently address their needs.

-   **Map enthusiasts**, Data visualization enthusiasts and OpenStreetMap users with a keen interest in EDI issues.

-   **Activists**, Researchers, or people sensitive to EDI issues and inequalities (we will particularly welcome people interested in issues related to gender, race or queer topics).

You are invited!

## Some findings

-   Bias in OSM's contributors -\> It is expected that it may influence how they contribute to the map -\> and how the map looks like.

-   Awareness in OSM, but not much has done.

-   Difficult tension:

    -   OSM universalists aspiration collides with feminist approaches that advocate for taking into account context and relations

# Takeaways {background-image="img/neutral-map.png" background-opacity="0.7"}

-   No map is perfect. No map is neutral. No map is finished.

-   OpenStreetMap is not an exception to this, but it is a cool project.

    -   Join it and use it! -\> <https://openstreetmap.org>

-   Our research aims to understand OSM better and contribute to make it more equitable.
